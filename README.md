# ScrapeLinkedinProfile
I have used Selenium and BeautiSoup to scrape data from the Linkedin Profiles.

The code will help you extract details out of as many Linkedin Profiles you desire.
The results will be obtained in systematic format in CSV format.

The Links you provide in the input CSV file will be separated into two categories, one which work and the ones whose links are down. This will help the code to run without having to stop because of a bad link.
